# Inviting Your Bot
Below is an example of how you can invite your bot to a server!
If you want others to use your bot be sure to click "**Public Bot**" and give the link you generated to other people.
You can mess around with the permissions if you know what you're doing, but giving it Administrator gives it full power!
